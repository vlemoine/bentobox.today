# About

My kid is a selective eater with irrational hate for PB&J. If it were up to them, they would eat fried rice every day.

This school year, I made an effort to make a lunch they would enjoy and not come back barely eaten and straight into the trash. Also, it fulfilled my unrealized deep desire to start collecting bento picks.
