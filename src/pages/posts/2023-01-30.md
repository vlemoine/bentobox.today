## Today's lunch

- 🐙 Hot dog octopus
- 🍘 Furikake rice balls
- 🥒 Baby cucumbers
- 🍓 Strawberry
- 🫑 Bell pepper strips
- 🥜 Trail mix (with a secret Hershey's Kiss)
- 🥫 Ketchup

## Aftermath

- Didn't like the furikake rice, but I think its because it was freezer burnt (it was in the freezer since ... October 🙈)
- Doesn't want strawberry - but it's in season!!! 😤
